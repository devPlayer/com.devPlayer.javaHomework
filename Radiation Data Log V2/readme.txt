The historical data are stored in the file data.txt,
using the following format:

mean;min;max;timestamp;data

where each one of theses values describes each session's data.
This format, even though not convenient to read, was chosen in order
to make the data processing easier.

If you want to use your own file, you must replace the file "data.txt" with your file,
which must follows the same signature.

Browsing for files wasn't implemented in this version of the application, since it
was outside the scope of the material that we covered in the classroom.
